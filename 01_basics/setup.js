//The difference in a js file and a normal txt file is that
//by injecting JS file in a software (compiler, interpreter) we can execute it

//For long time, this compiler was hidden in a browser
//but now Node.js, Deno.js executes JS files

//Node.js is an open source, cross platform, javascript runtime environment
